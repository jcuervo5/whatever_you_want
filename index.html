        <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get close to the 
        equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API 
        to assemble a dataset on over 500 random cities.</p>

        <p>After assembling the dataset, Matplotlib was used to plot various aspects of the weather 
        vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and 
        humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the 
        analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations 
        witnessed.</p>
